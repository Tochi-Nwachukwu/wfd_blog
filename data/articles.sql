Medication abortion, commonly called "the abortion pill," is a safe and effective way to end an early pregnancy using medications instead of surgery.

## How It Works

The medication abortion process typically involves two medications:

### Mifepristone

## Timeline and Process

1. **Day 1**: Take mifepristone at clinic
2. **Day 2-3**: Take misoprostol at home
3. **Follow-up**: Check-in with provider within 1-2 weeks

## What to Expect
- **Cramping and bleeding** similar to a heavy period
- **Duration**: Bleeding may last 1-2 weeks
- **Pain management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers are usually sufficient

## Effectiveness
- **95-98% effective** when used correctly

Misinformation about abortion is widespread. Here are evidence-based facts to help you understand the reality of abortion care.

## Safety and Medical Facts

### Myth: Abortion is dangerous
**Fact**: Abortion is extremely safe when performed by trained providers. The risk of major complications is less than 0.5%, making it safer than many common medical procedures.

### Myth: Abortion causes mental health problems
**Fact**: Research shows that the most common emotion after abortion is relief. Mental health issues are rare and usually related to pre-existing conditions or lack of support.

### Myth: Abortion affects future fertility
**Fact**: Safe abortion does not affect your ability to get pregnant or carry future pregnancies to term.

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth: "Abortion reversal" is possible
**Fact**: There is no scientifically proven way to "reverse" a medication abortion once the process has begun. Claims about "abortion reversal" are not supported by medical evidence.

### Myth: Abortion is used as birth control
**Fact**: Most people who have abortions were using contraception when they became pregnant. Contraceptive failure, not lack of responsibility, is often the cause of unplanned pregnancy.

### Myth: Only certain types of people have abortions
**Fact**: People of all backgrounds, ages, religions, and family situations may need abortion care. There is no typical "abortion patient."

## Legal and Access Issues

### Myth: Abortion is illegal everywhere

It''s important to understand the difference between emergency contraception and abortion, as they work at different stages and in different ways.

## Emergency Contraception

### What It Is
- **Prevents pregnancy** before it occurs
- **Not an abortion** - does not end existing pregnancy
- **Time-sensitive** - most effective when taken quickly

### Types Available
1. **Plan B (levonorgestrel)**
   - Available over-the-counter
   - Most effective within 72 hours
   - Can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected sex

2. **ella (ulipristal acetate)**
   - Requires prescription
   - Effective up to 120 hours
   - More effective than Plan B between 72-120 hours

3. **Copper IUD**
   - Most effective emergency contraception
   - Can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sex
   - Provides ongoing contraception

### How It Works
Emergency contraception primarily works by:
- **Delaying or preventing ovulation**
- **May affect fertilization** in some cases
- **Does not affect** an already implanted pregnancy

## Abortion Care

### What It Is
- **Ends an existing pregnancy**
- **After implantation** has occurred
- **Medical or surgical** procedures available

### When It''s Needed
- **Confirmed pregnancy** via test
- **Usually after** missed period

|--------|------------------------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Prevents pregnancy | Ends existing pregnancy |
| **Timing** | Before implantation | After implantation |
| **Pregnancy test** | Usually negative | Positive |
| **Availability** | Many available OTC | Requires healthcare provider |

## Making Informed Decisions
- **Take a pregnancy test** if your period is late
- **Emergency contraception** is most effective when taken quickly

- **Both options** are safe and legal forms of reproductive healthcare', 1, '2025-08-11', true, 'https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/static/9998fb543550dd331d7eb317c09de1f7/48819/myths-and-facts-around-contraception-en.webp'),
